A two-step deep learning network was first applied to automatically segment the liver andspleen regions on CT images. The input CT images were resampled to a slice thickness of 3mm. The network was based on two 3D fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and wasoptimized for cirrhosis and splenomegaly, which was described in our previous studyl and
is available online (https://github.com/vanziaaaHVPG).
